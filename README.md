# Taxes

Tax awareness is important not only because of your legal obligation to file taxes correctly, but also because planning ahead can increase your returns by reducing the taxes you pay. Even if you pay someone to do your taxes, you need to understand the principles here. There are mistakes and suboptimal actions that your accountant cannot fix retroactively. Overcontributing to your IRA or accidentally triggering wash sales can lead to a great deal of needless stress, paperwork, and potential tax penalties.

The information below is general and tax law is very particular. Somewhat different rules apply to you if you derive most of your income from farming or fishing. People with permanent disabilities receive very different tax treatment — these are just two examples. Understanding your own situation is important.

For the typical taxpayer who wants to do it on their own, I recommend [FreeTaxUSA](https://www.freetaxusa.com/). They're part of the IRS Free File Alliance, so you can file for free if your income is under the threshold ($73K in 2022). And if it's above the threshold, they charge an extremely reasonable $0 for the federal return and $15 for each state return. Although they don't have every streamlined feature that TurboTax does, they make it very easy and their explanations are totally clear. [This article](https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free) is a good read on how lobbying by Intuit (creator of TurboTax) is almost single-handedly responsible for the absence of free, pre-filled filing software for all Americans. TurboTax and H&R Block have withdrawn from the IRS Free File Alliance.

## The essentials

If you aren't sure you completely understand marginal tax rates, and how a marginal tax rate differs from an average or effective tax rate, go ahead and watch [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHGKwQGYlEY) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJL4UT4wAxc) brief videos. This is a prerequisite to understanding everything else.

We'll begin with the distinction between income and taxable income. Let's say we're a single filer who earned $63,250 from our job in 2022. We also realized $5,000 in capital gains, and adding these two values gives us our [gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp) of $68,250. We donated at least $300 to charity in 2022, so [we can deduct](https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/the-irs-encourages-taxpayers-to-consider-charitable-contributions) $300 from our taxable income, even though we're taking the standard deduction.<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> Subtracting $300 from our gross income of $68,250 provides our [adjusted gross income (AGI)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/adjusted-gross-income-agi) of $67,950. Most people take the standard deduction, because it's preferable to itemizing deductions unless you donate a great deal to charity or pay a lot of tax-deductible interest (among other reasons). The federal [standard deduction](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/standard-deduction) for income tax in 2022 is $12,950 for single filers and twice that ($25,900) for married people filing jointly. So we subtract $12,950 from our AGI, leaving us with a taxable income of $55,000. This is the amount that will be subject to federal income tax.

A central concept is the distinction between short- and long-term capital gains. A [long-term gain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-term_capital_gain_loss.asp) results from a [position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/position.asp) that was closed more than a year after it was opened, and the federal government taxes long-term gains at lower rates to encourage investment rather than rapid trading. A short-term gain — arising from a position with a [holding period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiod.asp) of one year or less — is taxed as ordinary income.

The plot below shows the marginal tax rates for single filers in 2022 (i.e., for taxes you will file in early 2023). As you can see, most investors are taxed at a marginal rate of 15% for long-term capital gains but a higher rate for ordinary income. Joint filers have thresholds that are exactly double those of single filers at the low end. However, the thresholds at the high end are less advantageous for married couples — they're pushed into the 20% marginal rate with lower incomes per person.<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> You can see all rates for ordinary income and capital gains [here](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets) and [here](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates).

Those with high incomes may be affected by the [net investment income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netinvestmentincome.asp), which adds a 3.8% tax to capital gains if your [modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp) exceeds a certain threshold. The tax is [applied](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/questions-and-answers-on-the-net-investment-income-tax) to net investment income above $200K for single filers and $250K for joint filers. It means that some people pay an 18.8% marginal rate on long-term gains instead of 15%, and nearly all those in the 20% bracket pay 23.8%.

<p align="center">

</p>

As you might assume, you'll be taxed according to your _net_ investment gains. Ideally you could minimize short-term gains, because of their higher tax rate. But your short-term gains and losses balance out and, separately, your long-term gains and losses balance out. Only if you realize a net gain in one category and a net loss in the other do they offset one another. A net long-term gain of $5,000 and a net short-term loss of $1,000 would leave you with a tax bill on $4,000 in long-term gains. Any final net loss once the two categories have settled up is the same: it reduces your taxable income, regardless of whether the losses were short-term or long-term.

Deduction from your taxable income in a given year has a limit of $3,000 (unless you establish trader tax status, which is for very frequent traders). Any net losses that exceed the limit can be deferred to future years. But if losses are carried over, then the distinction between short-term and long-term net losses begins to [matter](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p544). For instance, if you realized a $5,000 net loss in Year 1 composed entirely of long-term losses, you would deduct $3,000 from your income in Year 1. In Year 2, you would have the opportunity to offset $2,000 of capital gains, but the long-term losses would preferentially cancel long-term gains. So net short-term and net long-term losses (or a combination of the two) are meaningfully different outcomes if total net losses exceed $3,000.

Let's say in our example above with $5,000 of capital gains, we realized a net $2,000 in short-term capital gains and a net $3,000 in long-term capital gains in 2022. How much federal income tax will we pay? You can imagine these amounts stacked on each other, with the earned income on the bottom, the net short-term capital gain in the middle, and the net long-term capital gain on top. You want the long-term gain on top because its marginal rate is lower than that of ordinary income for nearly every taxpayer.<sup id="fn3">[[3]](#f3)</sup> Because short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, we can merge the earned income and short-term gain into $52,000 of ordinary income. If you like, below everything you can imagine the standard deduction of $12,950, which is taxed at 0%.

[We pay](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets) 10% on the first $10,275 of taxable income ([$1,027.50](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=.1*10275)), then 12% up to $41,775 ([$3,780](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=.12*%2841775-10275%29)), then 22% up to $52,000 ([$2,249.50](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=.22*%2852000-41775%29)), for a total of $7,057. Our net long-term capital gain of $3K is on top of the imaginary stack of $52K of ordinary income, so it ranges from $52K to $55K. That entire range is higher than $41,675 but less than $459,750, so [we pay](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates) 15% on all of our long-term gains ([$450](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=.15*3000)), for a total of $7,507. The net investment income tax does not apply because our [MAGI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp) of $67,950 is far too low. See above for calculation of our AGI, which is equal to our MAGI in this situation. The most common difference between AGI and MAGI is that student loan interest can [sometimes](https://www.thebalance.com/student-loan-interest-deduction-3193022) be deducted from AGI, but is added back to calculate MAGI. Our _effective_ federal income tax rate is $7,507/$55,000 = 13.65%.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/investindex/Taxes/blob/main/Tax%20Rate%20Example.png" width="491" height="540"/>
</p>

FICA taxes, also known as payroll taxes, are an important federal tax in addition to income tax. 6.2% of your paycheck funds Social Security, and an additional 1.45% funds Medicare. These add to 7.65% of all your earned income (unless your income is high). The Social Security tax stops after $147K of individual earnings in 2022. But the Medicare tax has no income cap and actually escalates by 0.9% for income above $200K for single filers and $250K for joint filers. Continuing our example from above: the deductions for income tax do not apply to FICA tax, so we need to pay 7.65% on the full earned income of $63,250 (instead of $50,000). This works out to $4,839 in FICA taxes, which were likely withheld from our paycheck throughout the year. FICA taxes do not apply to capital gains or distributions, so we don't pay any more federal tax on our capital gains (including the short-term gain). That's a total of $12,345 in federal taxes.

The main way we could have reduced FICA taxes would have been to contribute to a [health savings account (HSA)](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#health-savings-accounts) through our employer's payroll deduction. We could have contributed as much as $3,650 in 2022 and reduced our earned income that was subject to FICA taxes by that amount (or by up to $7,300 for a family insurance plan). An additional $1,000 is allowed for those who are at least 55 years old. Assuming a single plan and age less than 55, maxing out these contributions would have reduced our federal income tax and FICA taxes by [$1,082](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=3650%28.22%2B.0765%29). Contributing $6,000 to a traditional IRA would have reduced our federal income tax by a further [$1,320](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=6000*.22) (with no effect on FICA taxes). These contributions would reduce our AGI by a total of $9,650, from $67,950 to $58,300. Our MAGI of $64,300 would be computed by adding back the $6,000 IRA contribution but not the HSA contribution. 401(k) contributions could have reduced income tax further, and we would want to prioritize these above IRA contributions if our employer had a matching policy. Depending on the state we work in, these actions could save even more taxes by reducing state income and payroll taxes.

#### Further essentials

The above refers only to federal taxes. State tax policies on capital gains vary; check those for your own state. Most commonly, some states tax all capital gains as ordinary income and some states do not tax capital gains. There are other policies: some states tax short-term and long-term gains at different rates; some states have a distinct rate or rates for all capital gains or have a unique deduction for capital gains.

In the context of taxes, a [lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxlotaccounting.asp) refers to a group of shares purchased in a single transaction. When selling shares of a stock or fund, the [FIFO (first in, first out)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fifo.asp) method is the default. This is because if you purchased shares of the same security on different days, you will automatically sell the lots purchased earliest and, if possible, make use of any long-term capital gains tax rates. You can use a [different method](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/taxlots.asp) of selecting lots to sell if it benefits you — these are called disposal methods.

Any interest you earn on cash sitting in your brokerage account is taxed as ordinary income.

[Dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp), whether reinvested or not, are taxed. This is true of dividends you receive from stocks as well as stock funds. The terms "ex-dividend date" and "qualified dividend" should be understood. Those who own shares at the end of the business day before the ex-dividend date will receive the upcoming dividend payment, regardless of whether they sell some or all of their shares before the payment. Those who buy shares on or after the ex-dividend date will not receive it. (This implies that the value of each share falls by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.) A dividend you receive is qualified if the security is traded on US exchanges and you owned the shares for at least 60 days during the 121-day window starting 60 days before and ending 60 days after the ex-dividend date. The day you acquired the security [does not count](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2021_publink100010067) toward the 60 day minimum, but the day you disposed of it does. The distinction matters because qualified dividends are taxed as long-term capital gains, whereas ordinary dividends are taxed as short-term gains — ordinary income. When you receive dividends from a fund, you are not in complete control of their tax status. The fund must satisfy the 60-day requirement with respect to its ownership of the shares, and you must satisfy it with respect to your ownership of the fund shares.

Bond funds regularly pay dividends, but these are different than the dividends you receive from stocks and stock funds. They are always taxed as ordinary income. And unlike stock ETFs, bond ETFs may need to distribute capital gains at the end of each year, which will cause you to adjust your short- and long-term capital gains according to the gains or losses realized in the fund. As with stock funds, capital gains or losses derived from selling shares of bond funds count as either short- or long-term capital gains, depending on whether the holding period is more than one year.

Unrealized gains do not apply to taxes: if you buy shares but have not sold any, the gain or loss is not taxable until the shares are sold and it becomes a realized gain or loss. As stated previously, capital gains distributions from mutual funds make their tax burden higher and more complicated than the tax burdens arising from stocks and stock ETFs. Because stock ETFs do not need to distribute capital gains, they should be favored over mutual funds in taxable accounts. Stocks and stock ETFs still have involuntary taxable events when dividend payments occur.

## Tax-advantaged accounts

We introduced the basics of tax-advantaged accounts in [a previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts). We'll cover some additional details here, starting with IRAs.

#### Traditional IRAs

As mentioned previously, traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible. However, if you're covered by a retirement plan at work — usually a 401(k) or 403(b) — _and_ your income is high enough, this is [not true](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/2022-ira-contribution-and-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deductible-contributions-if-you-are-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work). Everyone can contribute to a traditional IRA, but if your [modified AGI (MAGI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp) is at least $78K for single filers or at least $129K for joint filers, it will not reduce your taxable income. Single filers making $68K-$78K and joint filers making $109K-$129K can take only a partial deduction, based on a linear sliding scale. For example, a 40-year-old single filer with a 401(k) option at work who made a $6K maximum contribution would be able to deduct only $3K from their taxable income if their MAGI were $73K (halfway between $68K and $78K). As mentioned previously, those who are at least 50 start with a higher maximum of $7K. These limitations mean that if your income exceeds $68K (for single filers) or $109K (for joint filers), you’re almost certainly better off ignoring your traditional IRA and investing through your employer-sponsored retirement plan (or your HSA!). If your employer doesn’t offer a retirement plan, then these income caps don’t apply to you, unless you’re married and your spouse _is_ covered by a work plan. If only one spouse is covered by a work retirement plan, then [deductions](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a) for traditional IRA contributions start phasing out at $204K and terminate at $214K.

Traditional IRAs and similar accounts have [required minimum distributions (RMDs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredminimumdistribution.asp). The government wants you to pay income tax on that tax-deferred money eventually, so in your old age they compel you to withdraw a fraction of the IRA's value that depends on your age and population-level expected lifespan. The age at which RMDs begin was previously 70½, but it is now 72 and a bill [currently in Congress](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-tax-playbook-for-draining-your-401-k-in-retirement-11649079814) would gradually raise it to 75 by 2033. RMDs up to $100K can be donated to charity in a tax-deductible manner if you have no need for them and want to avoid the income taxes that they would otherwise trigger. Roth IRAs do _not_ have RMDs, because taxes on that money were fully paid when you contributed to the account. Oddly, Roth 401(k) accounts do have RMDs even though no tax is owed, but these can be avoided by rolling over the account to a Roth IRA.

#### Roth IRAs

Not everyone can contribute directly to a Roth IRA: if your modified AGI is at least $144K for single filers or $214K for joint filers in 2022, you [cannot contribute](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2022) to a Roth IRA. Reductions in the maximum contribution proceed on a linear sliding scale from $129K-$144K for single filers and $204K-$214K for joint filers. For example, a 40-year-old single filer with a MAGI of $134K could contribute a maximum of $4K to their Roth IRA. This income cap is toothless, however, because anyone can still contribute the maximum to a Roth IRA [through a backdoor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/). You first contribute to a traditional IRA and immediately convert it to a Roth IRA (paying taxes on the contributions, as any Roth IRA contributor would). Congress has contemplated outlawing backdoor Roth IRAs but has never done so.

These income restrictions imply that for people with employer-sponsored retirement plans and high enough income — single filers > $78K and joint filers > $129K — a Roth IRA or backdoor Roth IRA is always superior to a traditional IRA. However, this doesn't mean they _should_ use a Roth IRA, because many such people would benefit more from additional contributions to their traditional 401(k) or HSA, thereby reducing taxes in the current year.

To be clear: traditional 401(k) accounts have no income restrictions on tax deductibility, and Roth 401(k) accounts have no income restrictions on contribution limits.

#### Contribution timing

As you might expect, 401(k) contributions can apply only to the current year: contributions for tax year 2022 cannot be made after Dec 31 2022, and they generally need to be made through payroll deduction. HSA contributions do not _need_ to be made through payroll deduction but it would be foolish not to do so, because contributing the money yourself would cause you to owe FICA tax on that income. In contrast to 401(k) contributions, IRA and HSA contributions can be delayed until tax day of the following year (roughly April 15). This allows you to assess the tax consequences of traditional IRA contribution or whether you are eligible for direct Roth IRA contribution. If there is any uncertainty about whether you might exceed Roth IRA contribution limits, _do not contribute_ to your Roth IRA until the year is over and you can be certain. When you contribute to an IRA, your broker will ask you to characterize the contribution: you will mark it as (a) for the current year, (b) for the previous year, or (c) from a rollover, most commonly from a 401(k).

#### HSAs

There are no income restrictions on contributing to HSAs. Despite all the features I’ve [celebrated](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#health-savings-accounts) about HSAs, there is some potentially [bad news](https://impersonalfinances.com/california-and-new-jersey-tax-hsas/). HSA contributions are tax-deductible with regard to federal income tax, FICA taxes, and state taxes in most _but not all_ states. There are two holdouts: California and New Jersey. In these two states, HSA contributions and earnings receive no state tax breaks. Despite the federal government designating HSAs as tax-advantaged accounts nearly 20 years ago, CA and NJ do not agree and will tax you like you’re investing in a taxable account. If you plan to live in either of these states for a long time, the arguments I’ve made about HSA investing are far weaker. Separately, New Hampshire has a mild tax which doesn't amount to a major drawback of HSAs in that state. NH [taxes](https://www.revenue.nh.gov/faq/interest-dividend.htm#who) interest and dividends that exceed $2,400 for single filers and $4,800 for joint filers. Surprisingly, interest and dividends in your HSA are included. However, since NH doesn't tax capital gains, the effect of this tax on your returns will be negligible unless you have a very large portfolio. For people with taxable portfolios smaller than $200K, this is likely to trigger zero tax. Tennessee had a similar tax until [recently](https://www.beacontn.org/hall-tax-finally-gone-forever). Feel free to write to representatives in these three states, especially CA and NJ, encouraging them to repent.

#### Saver's credit

The retirement savings contributions credit — commonly called the saver's credit — is a major incentive for people with low income to contribute to retirement accounts. Depending on your AGI, [between 10% and 50%](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) of your contribution can be provided as a tax credit, with a cap of $1,000. A single filer with an AGI of $20,000 in 2022 could contribute $1,000 to a Roth IRA and receive $500 at tax time. Contributions to a 401(k) could potentially be rewarded with employer matching as well. Unfortunately, students enrolled full-time during any part of five calendar months of the tax year are ineligible. So it doesn't help most people in their year of college graduation, when they might have unusually low income compared to later years.

There's an important distinction between a refundable tax credit, like the [earned income credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc), and a nonrefundable credit. A refundable credit can not only reduce tax liability to zero, but it can make it negative, resulting in a net payment to the tax filer. However, the saver's credit is nonrefundable, which means that it can lower your ordinary income tax liability to zero, but cannot reduce it further. So the credit may be less than you expect if you owe very little federal income tax. The single filer with an AGI of $20,000 — assuming the whole amount is earned income — would owe [$705](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%2820000-12950%29*.1) in federal income tax. So the saver's credit would be 50% of their IRA contribution for any contribution up to $1,410, but the credit could not exceed $705 (and regardless of circumstances, the credit cannot exceed $1,000). Even though they paid [$1,530](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=20000*.0765) in FICA taxes, income tax credits have no effect on this liability.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Roth or traditional?

No one should have all their retirement funds in either a traditional or Roth account — at least, no one who has been planning for retirement throughout their career and has always had both account types available to them. (The Roth IRA was established in [1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxpayer_Relief_Act_of_1997), and the maximum contribution in 1998 was $2,000.) We can illustrate this by considering two extreme investors who use only one type of account, and we'll name the characters [Bob and William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth_IRA#History) after the sponsors of the Roth IRA bill.

First imagine Bob, who invested purely in Roth accounts. Bob cultivated a huge nest egg of tax-exempt money, and now every year when he withdraws during retirement, his income taxes are zero. This may feel like a great accomplishment, but it was a miscalculation that made him poorer. Let's back up to his last year before retirement, when he's in the 32% federal marginal tax bracket and the 8% state marginal tax bracket (the state brackets will be made up). He has all his money in Roth accounts and is considering where to contribute. If Bob chose to contribute to Roth accounts this year, he would pay 40% income tax on the contributions, then he would withdraw it in his first year of retirement and pay zero tax. (_Red buzzer sound effect_ — wrong!) Instead, he could have paid zero income tax on the last year's contributions by contributing to traditional accounts, then zero tax when withdrawing because his taxable income was so low! Bob did not have enough in traditional accounts: he surrendered wealth by frontloading taxes.

Alternatively, imagine William, who invested only in traditional accounts. He's happy that he made a ton of tax-deductible contributions, which greatly reduced taxes during his working years. In his first year of retirement, he withdrew enough to fall into the 24% federal bracket and 6% state bracket, so he pays a 30% marginal rate. To see where the mistake was made in this case, we need to back up to the beginning of his career. Sometime in his 20s, William started earning significant income and wisely contributing to retirement accounts. He contributed to traditional accounts despite being in the 12% federal and 2% state marginal tax brackets. (_Red buzzer again_.) We can imagine two journeys the money earned in his 20s could have taken.

Let's say that for five years William set aside $5K per year before income taxes, for a total of $25K. The $25K could have been contributed after taxes to a Roth account, so the contribution would have been $25K × .86 = $21.5K. Or the $25K could have been contributed in full to a traditional account. Let's say that in the next 40 years, these contributions are invested in stocks and multiply by 18 in nominal terms (i.e., not adjusted for inflation). So the Roth amount of $21.5K would grow to $387K and the traditional amount of $25K would grow to $450K. When the money is finally withdrawn from a Roth IRA over a number of years, there is no tax owed, so it is still $387K after tax. When the money is withdrawn from a traditional IRA each year and subject to 30% tax, the after-tax value of the withdrawal is smaller even though the pre-tax amount was larger: $450K × .7 = $315K. By contributing some money to Roth accounts, William would have been able to reduce his marginal (and effective) tax rates in retirement. He surrendered wealth by backloading taxes and paying too much tax in retirement.

So the question is not whether Roth or traditional accounts are better, but _when_ it makes sense to contribute to each type of account. Pay taxes now or later? The goal is to distribute payment of income tax from your earning years to your non-earning years, but not by so much that you pay higher taxes during non-earning years. Executed properly, this decreases your lifetime tax paid and increases your wealth significantly.

[The rest of this is disorganized for now but will be organized and expanded later.]

#### Other variables

Marginal tax rates are not a static figure. Let's say someone is a single filer in 2022 with $44,175 of taxable ordinary income. The threshold for the federal tax rate of 22% is $41,175, so $3,000 of their income is taxed at 22%. They could contribute $3,000 to a traditional IRA, which would reduce their taxable income and drop their marginal tax rate to 12%. Now none of their income is taxed at 22%. If they estimated that their _effective_ federal tax rate in retirement will be above 12% but below 22%, it could make sense to contribute the remaining $3,000 to a Roth IRA.

FICA taxes are not relevant to the question of Roth vs. traditional accounts, because regardless of retirement contributions you immediately pay FICA taxes on that income. However, it is relevant when you consider contributing to an HSA, because HSA contributions through payroll deduction are not subject to FICA taxes.

An important external factor is whether tax brackets change over time (aside from inflation adjustments). If you expect taxes to be higher in the future, this should increase the weight you give to Roth accounts; if you expect taxes to be lower in the future, this should advantage traditional accounts. I don't recommend attempting to make these predictions. However, there is an aspect of tax rates within your control. If you intend to move to a state with significantly lower taxes than the state(s) you work in, this would advantage traditional accounts; if your retirement state has higher taxes, this would advantage Roth accounts.

In your early years of retirement, under most circumstances it makes sense to draw down your taxable assets first. During this period, your taxable income is likely to be low, so it presents a perfect opportunity for [Roth conversion](https://www.investopedia.com/roth-ira-conversion-rules-4770480). This means that you'll transfer money from your traditional IRA to your Roth IRA and add that amount to your taxable income. Those funds will be able to grow tax-free in your Roth IRA and will be withdrawn or inherited tax-free. During your working years, Roth conversions can be considered if you experience a year with unusually low income, perhaps due to taking a break from work.

If you have a long-term partner, all these considerations need to be placed in the context of your combined finances, regardless of whether you are legally married and file taxes jointly.

#### Inheritance

Another layer of complexity is added when you consider inheritance. Although it's hopefully not something you need to think about until at least middle age, unexpected death can happen at any time without warning. Everyone should have beneficiaries named on all their accounts and understand the tax consequences. Beneficiaries named on an account supersede your will. When your beneficiary inherits an IRA, they're required to empty the account by the end of the tenth year after the death of the original account holder. Death in August 2023 would require depletion by the end of 2033, because the ten-year period would be 2024-2033. If the beneficiary inherits a traditional account, the withdrawals will be subject to income tax. But if they inherit a Roth account, the taxes will have already been paid. Depending on your tax rates during retirement and the beneficiary's tax rates in the years following your death, it may make sense for you to perform a Roth conversion even if it doesn't maximize your wealth, because it will maximize your beneficiary's wealth.

If your tax rates in old age are lower than those your beneficiary expects in the ten years after you die, Roth conversions should be considered. This can also influence which accounts you assign to different beneficiaries. If you have two children with different incomes and you'd like them to inherit equal amounts, you could leave more than half of the traditional IRA to the child who earns less, and more than half of the Roth IRA to the child who earns more. This would increase the after-tax value of the inheritance. If the beneficiary is a spouse or a minor child, the distribution schedule [differs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beware-this-change-in-the-rules-for-retirement-account-rmds-11625612025). A spouse must take RMDs only at the rate their deceased spouse would have, which could enable many years of growth before RMDs begin. A minor child is eligible to delay RMDs in the same way, but only until they reach a [certain age](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beware-this-change-in-the-rules-for-retirement-account-rmds-11625612025) between 18 and 26 depending on circumstances. After reaching that age, a minor child must also empty the account in ten years.

## Wash sale rules

Absent [wash sale](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsale.asp) rules, someone could artificially declare a loss for tax purposes by selling a poorly performing stock near the year’s end and buying it again immediately. Under US tax law, the realized loss would count as a "wash sale" and would be deferred for tax purposes. Of course, this position — whether the investor decides to close it in the given year or in a later year — will affect their taxes at some point, although waiting to close could result in an eventual profit. But wash sale rules prevent investors from exercising total control over the year in which capital losses qualify as tax deductions.

What are the details? If you close a position that resulted in a loss, the IRS will view it as a wash sale if it is replaced within the 61-day window starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after the sale. That is, the losses will be deferred for tax purposes until the new position is also closed. Frequent trading on the same security can lead to indefinite deferral of any losses; the loss can be transferred to the cost basis of the next trade an unlimited number of times. The loss or losses will be tax-deductible once a non-wash sale occurs. Unlike losses, gains will always be taxed in the year they were realized.

Imagine you buy 50 shares of a stock at $40 on April 15 of Year 1 and sell them at $60 on May 15, for a gain of $1,000. You buy 50 shares of the same stock at $55 on July 1 and sell at $25 on October 1, for a loss of $1,500. Finally you buy 50 shares at $20 on October 15 and sell at $22 on January 15 of Year 2, for a $100 gain. In March you pay your Year 1 taxes. Without the wash sale rule, the first two sales would apply to your taxes in Year 1, and you would deduct the $500 net loss from your income. But because you repurchased a security on October 15 within 30 days of selling the same security at a loss, the IRS will count the October 1 sale as a wash sale. For tax purposes, the loss in this case will be deferred to Year 2. You will pay taxes on your $1,000 capital gain even though your stock trading in Year 1 resulted in a net loss of $500.

The example above has important implications which become more evident when magnified. If someone has gross gains and losses which are far larger than their net gain, and they inadvertently defer some of their losses to the following year, the results can be troublesome. [One amateur day trader](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2021/03/26/robinhood-trader-may-face-800000-tax-bill) made a net profit of $45K on top of his salary of $60K in 2020 after thousands of trades, but because he unwittingly deferred much of his seven-figure gross losses to the 2021 tax year, his capital gains for tax purposes were enormous. The tax bill was over $800K.

How exactly are wash sales counted for tax purposes? We can illustrate it by returning to our example above. The cost basis of your first purchase on April 15 was $40 × 50 = $2,000 and the value upon sale on May 15 was $3,000, yielding a $1,000 profit. None of this was affected by the future wash sale. When you bought 50 more shares on July 1, the cost basis was $2,750 and the value upon the October 1 sale was $1,250. Because the October 1 sale was rendered a wash sale by the repurchase on October 15, the loss of $1,500 was transferred to the cost basis of the new purchase. So the October 15 cost basis was $20 × 50 = $1,000 plus the loss’s magnitude, yielding $2,500. Had you sold before the end of Year 1 and not repurchased within 30 days, the wash sale would not have affected your taxes. But because you held the stock until January 15, the loss was deferred to Year 2. The value upon selling the shares at $22 was $1,100. This yielded a $100 profit, but for tax purposes it served as a loss: $1,100 - $2,500 = -$1,400. As long as another repurchase does not occur within 30 days, the IRS will recognize the $1,400 loss in Year 2. Remember that in real trading, fees may slightly alter the calculations.

-A wash sale can be triggered inadvertently by dividend reinvestment. If you sell some but not all shares of a dividend-paying stock, and a dividend is reinvested within 30 days before or after the sale, the sale will be designated as a wash sale.

-You can’t avoid a wash sale designation by selling stock at a loss in a taxable account, then repurchasing it in a tax-advantaged account. The same applies to a repurchase by your spouse. If you repurchase in a tax-advantaged account, the loss is disallowed and cannot offset any gains. This is easy to do accidentally if you aren't keeping the rules in mind.

-When the loss from a wash sale is transferred to the cost basis of the repurchased security, the first holding period is added to the holding period of the newly purchased security. This potentially qualifies the combination as a long-term capital gain or loss when it would not have otherwise.

-Wash sale rules can’t be sidestepped by selling a stock and then purchasing an option on the same stock, for example. Repurchase of a “substantially identical” security, like a derivative, invokes the same wash sale rules.

-This is another regulation which can be bypassed if the IRS recognizes trader tax status.

## Tax loss harvesting

[Tax loss harvesting](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/121914/pros-and-cons-annual-taxloss-harvesting.asp) refers to the conscious use of realized losses to offset realized gains for tax purposes. We'll walk through an example, and also discuss a major caveat that many people don't consider.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBK_s5hsJzY) is a brief intro to tax loss harvesting and [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl6whcnrl_w&t=1205s) is a great discussion.

Let's imagine that most of your stock portfolio is allocated to [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) and [VXUS](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus), Vanguard's total US and total international stock ETFs. Earlier this year, you sold shares of VXUS and moved the cash into bond funds to rebalance your portfolio. It's unrealistic that rebalancing the stock/bond ratio and rebalancing within the stock portfolio required selling only VXUS, but we're trying to keep this example simple. You had held these shares for a long time, so the gains you realized were long-term capital gains and they amounted to $4,000. (Note that this doesn't mean you sold $4,000 of VXUS. It means the shares you sold had appreciated by $4,000.)

You're trying to minimize your taxes at the end of the year, and ideally you'd like to do so in a way that doesn't substantively change your portfolio. Let's say you buy VTI (and other funds) whenever you get a paycheck, so you have shares of VTI you've purchased within the last year. VTI has been doing poorly and your recently purchased shares have lost value. You're able to sell shares using the LIFO disposal method (last in, first out) and realize $3,000 in short-term losses. We'll pretend you didn't receive any dividends, and that your only realized gains and losses are $4,000 in long-term gains from VXUS and $3,000 in short-term losses from VTI.

However, we don't want this to change our portfolio. We also don't want to trigger a wash sale by immediately repurchasing VTI. So as soon as we sell VTI at a loss, we buy an equivalent amount of [SCHX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schx), a large cap ETF. We know they will have [highly similar](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=SCHX&allocation2_2=100) returns, because the large companies in SCHX represent most of VTI's weighted allocation, even though SCHX holds a fraction of VTI's 4,100 stocks. Yet the IRS does not consider them “substantially identical” securities, because they track different indices.

This is a clean example of tax loss harvesting, in which we offset $4,000 in realized gains with $3,000 in realized losses and pay taxes on only $1,000 of long-term gains. We would naturally want to prioritize the reduction of short-term gains, [if we had any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omguEZ7jy5E). But while this harvesting of losses may seem obviously good, there's a potential drawback. Let's imagine that two years in the future, we've held the shares of SCHX and need to sell them. They've appreciated by $10,000, and there are no losses we can realize to counterbalance these gains. Consider the counterfactual: if we had kept the shares of VTI we sold, and sold those now, the tax bill would be smaller this year. Instead of paying taxes on $10,000 of gains, we would have had to initially recover from $3,000 of unrealized losses, and we would be paying taxes on $7,000 of gains.

This is crucial to understand about tax loss harvesting: when you harvest a loss, the new investment that replaces it has a lower [cost basis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp) (e.g., the cost basis of the SCHX purchase is lower than that of the VTI purchase). So tax loss harvesting does not make taxable gains disappear; it merely defers realization of gains. If your income were significantly higher in the year when you sold SCHX, your taxes may have increased more in that year than you saved in taxes two years prior by selling VTI. This concern is more relevant for short-term gains than long-term gains, because changes in your income are much more likely to affect your marginal tax bracket for ordinary income than for long-term capital gains.

So be thoughtful if you decide to harvest losses. Is your income likely to increase in the near future? If so, reducing your taxes this year by realizing losses may lead to an even bigger increase in your future taxes. If you're taking a break from work and you anticipate an income drop next year, then minimizing taxes this year could make sense. In addition, keep in mind that while total market index funds are easy to replace with another security, more specialized products are not. There are many substitutes for VTI that could be used to avoid wash sales, but not for [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html).

## Estimated tax payments

Hopefully you've noticed that when you receive a paycheck, some of your money is missing. Since the second world war, the federal government has not waited until tax day to take your money — they want it _now_. Your capital gains are not entirely exempt from this policy. If you wait until you file your taxes to pay tax on your realized capital gains, under certain circumstances the IRS will charge you interest and even penalties for paying that tax late. They may expect you to make [estimated payments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estimated-tax.asp) throughout the year.

Under what circumstances do you need to pay estimated tax? Thankfully, taxpayers can often safely ignore this provision. You do not need to make estimated payments if (a) you expect your federal withholding to be at least 90% of the total federal tax you owe; (b) you expect your federal withholding to be at least 100% of the tax you paid the prior year; or (c) the underpayment you anticipate will be less than $1,000. If any one of these statements is true, you do not need to make estimated payments. The figure in condition (b) is increased to 110% at an [AGI](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/adjusted-gross-income-agi) threshold of $150K.

If you find that you do need to pay estimated tax, how do you do it? The simplest method is to increase federal withholding through your employer. You'll effortlessly pay the correct amount of taxes, as long as you accurately estimate your total tax liability. The main alternative is a series of four, equal payments throughout the year. These are due by the 15th days of April, June, September, and January (in the following year). If you noticed that these dates are not spaced equally, that’s correct. When these dates fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the due date is postponed to the first day that is not that kind of day. There are [multiple ways](https://www.irs.gov/payments) to pay the IRS, the easiest of which is an online transfer directly from your checking account.

There's more information on estimated payments in [IRS publication 505](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p505). It's not as bad as it sounds. They even made a flowchart [here](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p505#en_US_2022_publink1000194559).

The practice of "estimated tax" may strike some people as guesswork. How can you be sure you're paying enough before the end of the year? Remember that condition (b) above sets a hard limit on the amount you're expected to pay before tax day. You're all set as long as you pay the IRS as much as you paid in federal taxes the prior year — or, if your income is higher, 110% of what you paid the prior year. If your tax liability has decreased compared to the prior year, following only this guideline could lead to significant overpayment, so keep the other conditions in mind.

Some states require estimated tax payments under certain conditions; research the requirements of your state(s).

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> Charitable donations can reduce your taxable income in addition to the standard deduction because they count as an [above the line](https://www.thebalance.com/above-the-line-deductions-to-reduce-your-tax-bill-4584471) deduction (up to $300 for single filers, $600 for joint filers). They can reduce your [adjusted gross income](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/adjusted-gross-income-agi) before you take the standard deduction. Other above the line deductions include [student loan interest](https://www.thebalance.com/student-loan-interest-deduction-3193022) up to $2,500 per year, as long as your income is low enough. Contributions to your HSA, 401(k), and IRA can also count, with income caveats for [the IRA](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#traditional-iras) but [not HSA or 401(k)](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#hsas).

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> This is a lesser-known fact of federal US taxes: it is assumed that being married provides a tax advantage, but for some very high earners being married is actually detrimental. Tax brackets for ordinary income are linked [here](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets) for reference. Let's start with a typical case of a couple with total income of $100K. Spouse A makes $40K and Spouse B makes $60K. If Spouse B were a single filer, their marginal tax rate would be 22%. But because they're married and file jointly, their taxable income (after the standard deduction of $25,900) is low enough that their marginal rate is only 12%. If their incomes were both exactly $50K, the effect of marriage on federal income tax would be perfectly neutral. However, any difference between two incomes that add to the same total gives an advantage to joint filers over single filers. So for typical taxpayers, marriage helps.

This pattern does not hold true if income is very high. Imagine a couple whose incomes add to $800K. If Spouse A makes $100K and Spouse B makes $700K, then they benefit from being married because Spouse B would pay 37% tax on more income as a single filer than the couple does as joint filers. However, if both spouses make $400K, their marginal rate as single filers would be 35%. Because they file jointly, their marginal rate is 37% instead. (It's possible for married people to file separately — which is distinct from the single filing status — but this is nearly always worse than filing jointly.)

So for federal income tax, there is a marriage penalty to high earners with fairly balanced incomes, but not to high-earning married couples with very imbalanced incomes. The marriage penalty for high earners is even more obvious in thresholds for [long-term capital gains](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates) ($445,850 vs. $501,600 for the 20% threshold), the net investment income tax ($200K vs. $250K), the additional Medicare tax ($200K vs. $250K), the phasing out of deductions for traditional IRA contributions ($78K vs. $129K), and the phasing out of eligibility for direct Roth IRA contributions ($144K vs. $214K). All of these thresholds are mentioned above. In addition, interest on [US Treasury savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds) is tax-deductible but is [phased out](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/planning/plan_education.htm) at higher MAGI (in 2021, $98,200 vs. $154,800).

For very high earners, taking advantage of long-term capital gains is especially important. The difference between 35% or 37% tax on ordinary income and 23.8% tax on long-term capital gains is somewhat greater than the difference between 22% or 24% tax on ordinary income and 15% or 18.8% tax on long-term capital gains. [↩](#fn2)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> There is a funny region of $100 of taxable income in which the marginal rate for ordinary income is _lower_ than the marginal rate for long-term capital gains. You can see it in the second image. The 0% capital gains rate increases to 15% above $41,675. Someone with a taxable income of $41,700 pays a marginal rate of 15% on capital gains but a marginal rate of only 12% on ordinary income! The threshold for the 22% rate is $41,775 for ordinary income. [↩](#fn3)
