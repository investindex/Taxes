# Taxes

Tax awareness is important not only because of your legal obligation to file taxes correctly, but also because planning ahead can increase your returns by reducing the taxes you pay. Even if you pay someone to do your taxes, you need to understand the principles here to avoid unwitting mistakes. This section applies only to trades in taxable accounts. It will describe taxes as they concern stock trading, and when needed it will expand with the additional knowledge required to trade stock funds and bond funds.

&nbsp;

## The essentials

A central concept is the distinction between short- and long-term capital gains. A [long-term gain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-term_capital_gain_loss.asp) results from a [position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/position.asp) that was closed more than a year after it was opened, and the federal government taxes long-term gains at lower rates to encourage investment rather than rapid trading. A short-term gain — arising from a position with a [holding period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiod.asp) of one year or less — is taxed as ordinary income.

As you might assume, you'll be taxed according to your _net_ gains. Ideally you could minimize short-term gains, because of their higher tax rate. But your short-term gains and losses balance out and, separately, your long-term gains and losses balance out. Only if you realize a net gain in one category and a net loss in the other do they offset one another. A net long-term gain of $5,000 and a net short-term loss of $1,000 would leave you with a tax bill for $4,000 in long-term gains. Any final net loss once the two categories have settled up is the same: it reduces your taxable income, regardless of whether the losses were short-term or long-term.

Deduction from your taxable income in a given year has a limit of $3,000 (unless you establish trader tax status, which is for very frequent traders). Any net losses that exceed the limit can be deferred to future years. But if losses are carried over, then the distinction between short-term and long-term net losses begins to [matter](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p544). For instance, if you realized a $5,000 net loss in Year 1 composed entirely of long-term losses, you would deduct $3,000 from your income in Year 1. In Year 2, you would have the opportunity to offset $2,000 of capital gains, but the long-term losses would preferentially cancel long-term gains. So net short-term and net long-term losses (or a combination of the two) are meaningfully different outcomes if total net losses exceed $3,000.

State tax policies on capital gains vary; check those for your own state. Most commonly, some states tax all capital gains as ordinary income and some states do not tax capital gains. There are other policies: some states tax short-term and long-term gains at different rates; some states have a distinct rate or rates for all capital gains or have a unique deduction for capital gains.

In this context, a [lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxlotaccounting.asp) refers to a group of shares purchased in a single transaction. When selling shares of a stock or fund, the [FIFO (first in, first out)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fifo.asp) method is the default. This is because if you purchased shares of the same security on different days, you will automatically sell the lots purchased earliest and, if possible, make use of any long-term capital gains tax rates. You can select a [different method](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/taxlots.asp) of selecting lots to sell if it benefits you — these are called disposal methods.

Any interest you earn on cash sitting in your brokerage account is taxed as ordinary income.

[Dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp), whether reinvested or not, are taxed. This is true of dividends you receive from stocks as well as stock funds. The terms _ex-dividend date_ and _qualified dividend_ should be understood. Those who own shares at market open (9:30am) on the ex-dividend date will receive the upcoming dividend payment, regardless of whether they sell some or all of their shares before the payment. Those who buy shares on or after the ex-dividend date will not receive it. (This implies that the value of each share falls by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.) A dividend you receive is qualified if the security is traded on US exchanges and you owned the shares for at least 60 days during the 121-day window starting 60 days before and ending 60 days after the ex-dividend date. The distinction matters because qualified dividends are taxed as long-term capital gains, whereas ordinary dividends are taxed as short-term gains — ordinary income. When you receive dividends from a fund, you are not in complete control of their tax status. The fund must satisfy the 60-day requirement with respect to its ownership of the shares, and you must satisfy it with respect to your ownership of the fund shares.

Bond funds regularly pay dividends, but these are different than the dividends you receive from stocks and stock funds. They are always taxed as ordinary income. And unlike stock ETFs, bond ETFs may need to distribute capital gains at the end of each year, which will cause you to adjust your short- and long-term capital gains according to the gains or losses realized in the fund. As with stock funds, capital gains or losses derived from selling shares of bond funds count as either short- or long-term capital gains, depending on whether the holding period is more than one year.

Those with six-figure total incomes should be aware of the [net investment income tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netinvestmentincome.asp), which elevates the tax rate on your capital gains if your [modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp) exceeds a certain threshold. This tax means that the highest tax rate for long-term capital gains is 23.8%, not 20%.

Unrealized gains do not apply to taxes: if you buy shares but have not sold any, the gain or loss is not taxable until the shares are sold and it becomes a realized gain or loss. As stated above, [capital gains distributions](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/taxes/mutual-funds-etfs) from mutual funds make their tax burden more complicated than the tax burdens arising from stocks and stock ETFs. Because stock ETFs do not need to distribute capital gains, they should be favored over mutual funds in taxable accounts. Stocks and stock ETFs still have involuntary taxable events when dividend payments occur.

## Wash sale rules

Absent [wash sale](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsale.asp) rules, someone could artificially declare a loss for tax purposes by selling a poorly performing stock near the year’s end and buying it again immediately. Under US tax law, the realized loss would count as a "wash sale" and would be deferred for tax purposes. Of course, this position — whether the investor decides to close it in the given year or in a later year — will affect their taxes at some point, although waiting to close could result in an eventual profit. But wash sale rules prevent investors from exercising total control over the year in which capital losses qualify as tax deductions.

What are the details? If you close a position that resulted in a loss, the IRS will view it as a wash sale if it is replaced within the 61-day window starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after the sale. That is, the losses will be deferred for tax purposes until the new position is also closed. Frequent trading on the same security can lead to indefinite deferral of any losses; the loss can be transferred to the cost basis of the next trade an unlimited number of times. The loss or losses will be tax-deductible once a non-wash sale occurs. Unlike losses, gains will always be taxed in the year they were realized.

Imagine you buy 50 shares of a stock at $40 on April 15 of Year 1 and sell them at $60 on May 15, for a gain of $1,000. You buy 50 shares of the same stock at $55 on July 1 and sell at $25 on October 1, for a loss of $1,500. Finally you buy 50 shares at $20 on October 15 and sell at $22 on January 15 of Year 2, for a $100 gain. In March you pay your Year 1 taxes. Without the wash sale rule, the first two sales would apply to your taxes in Year 1, and you would deduct the $500 net loss from your income. But because you repurchased a security on October 15 within 30 days of selling the same security at a loss, the IRS will count the October 1 sale as a wash sale. For tax purposes, the loss in this case will be deferred to Year 2. You will pay taxes on your $1,000 capital gain even though your stock trading in Year 1 resulted in a net loss of $500.

The example above has important implications which become more evident when magnified. If someone has gross gains and losses which are far larger than their net gain, and they inadvertently defer some of their losses to the following year, the results can be troublesome. [One amateur day trader](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2021/03/26/robinhood-trader-may-face-800000-tax-bill) made a net profit of $45K on top of his salary of $60K in 2020 after thousands of trades, but because he unwittingly deferred much of his seven-figure gross losses to the 2021 tax year, his capital gains for tax purposes were enormous. The tax bill was over $800K.

How exactly are wash sales counted for tax purposes? We can illustrate it by returning to our example above. The cost basis of your first purchase on April 15 was $40 × 50 = $2,000 and the value upon sale on May 15 was $3,000, yielding a $1,000 profit. None of this was affected by the future wash sale. When you bought 50 more shares on July 1, the cost basis was $2,750 and the value upon the October 1 sale was $1,250. Because the October 1 sale was rendered a wash sale by the repurchase on October 15, the loss of $1,500 was transferred to the cost basis of the new purchase. So the October 15 cost basis was $20 × 50 = $1,000 plus the loss’s magnitude, yielding $2,500. Had you sold before the end of Year 1 and not repurchased within 30 days, the wash sale would not have affected your taxes. But because you held the stock until January 15, the loss was deferred to Year 2. The value upon selling the shares at $22 was $1,100. This yielded a $100 profit, but for tax purposes it served as a loss: $1,100 - $2,500 = -$1,400. As long as another repurchase does not occur within 30 days, the IRS will recognize the $1,400 loss in Year 2. Remember that in real trading, fees may slightly alter the calculations.

-A wash sale can be triggered inadvertently by dividend reinvestment. If you sell some but not all shares of a dividend-paying stock, and a dividend is reinvested within 30 days before or after the sale, the sale will be designated as a wash sale.

-You can’t avoid a wash sale designation by selling stock at a loss in a taxable account, then repurchasing it in a tax-advantaged account. The same applies to a repurchase by your spouse. If you repurchase in a tax-advantaged account, the loss is disallowed and cannot offset any gains. This is easy to do accidentally if you aren't keeping the rules in mind.

-When the loss from a wash sale is transferred to the cost basis of the repurchased security, the first holding period is added to the holding period of the newly purchased security. This potentially qualifies the combination as a long-term capital gain or loss when it would not have otherwise.

-Wash sale rules can’t be sidestepped by selling a stock and then purchasing an option on the same stock, for example. Repurchase of a “substantially identical” security, like a contract, invokes the same wash sale rules.

-The same rules apply to short selling and then buying to cover. Instead of thinking only of _buying_ and _selling_, the general language of _opening_ and _closing_ a position shows how it applies to short selling. If you sold short on February 1 and then bought to cover on March 1 at a higher price, your loss would be deferred for tax purposes if a (short) sale on the same security (or a substantially identical security) occurred within 30 days before or after March 1.

-This is another regulation which can be bypassed if the IRS recognizes trader tax status.

## Tax loss harvesting

[Tax loss harvesting](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/121914/pros-and-cons-annual-taxloss-harvesting.asp) refers to the conscious use of realized losses to offset realized gains. We'll walk through an example, and also discuss a major caveat that many people don't consider.

Let's imagine that most of your stock portfolio is allocated to [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI) and [VXUS](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VXUS), Vanguard's total US and total international stock ETFs. Earlier this year, you sold shares of VXUS and moved the cash into bond funds to rebalance your portfolio. It's unrealistic that rebalancing the stock/bond ratio and rebalancing within the stock portfolio required selling only VXUS, but we're trying to keep this example simple. You had held these shares for a long time, so the gains you realized were long-term capital gains and they amounted to $5,000. (Note that this doesn't mean you sold $5,000 of VXUS. It means the shares you sold had gained $5,000 of value.)

You're trying to minimize your taxes at the end of the year, and ideally you'd like to do so in a way that doesn't substantively change your portfolio. Let's say you buy VTI whenever you get a paycheck, so you have shares of VTI you've purchased within the last year. VTI has been doing poorly and your recently purchased shares have lost value. You're able to sell shares using the LIFO disposal method (last in, first out) and realize $3,000 in short-term losses. We'll pretend you didn't receive any dividends, and that your only realized gains and losses are $5,000 in long-term gains from VXUS and $3,000 in short-term losses from VTI.

However, we don't want this to change our portfolio. We also don't want to trigger a wash sale by immediately repurchasing VTI. So as soon as we sell VTI at a loss, we buy an equivalent amount of [SCHX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schx), a large cap ETF. We know they will have [highly similar](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=SCHX&allocation2_2=100) returns, because the large companies in SCHX represent most of VTI's weighted allocation, even though SCHX holds a fraction of VTI's 4,100 stocks. Yet the IRS does not consider them “substantially identical” securities, because they track different indices.

This is a clean example of tax loss harvesting, in which we offset $5,000 in realized gains with $3,000 in realized losses and pay taxes on only $2,000 of long-term gains. We would naturally want to prioritize the reduction of short-term gains, if we had any.

## Quarterly estimated tax payments

Hopefully you've noticed that when you receive a paycheck, some of your money is missing. Since the second world war, the federal government has not waited until tax day to take your money — they want it _now_. Your capital gains are not entirely exempt from this policy. If you wait until you file your taxes to pay tax on your realized capital gains, under certain circumstances the IRS will charge you interest for paying that tax late. They expect you to make estimated payments throughout the year.
